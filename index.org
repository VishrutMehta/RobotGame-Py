* _Code Organization_:
** Class 1:
- the actual robot is made here in the first class and then i have encapsulated all the fields in that class. 
** Class 2:
- my code comprises of two module...One contains all the funcyions like game1,game2,game3,start1,start2,start3....
* _Class decomposition_:
- i have made two classes ...
** Class box1():
 - Actually i have done encapsulation in this class.The aking of my robot is done in this.I defined many functions like lenght,breath,move,list1....these fields i am encapsulating it into robot1..
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
class box1():
	pass
def robot1(listing):
	b=box1()
	b.length=3;#change
	b.breadth=3;#c
	b.startx=listing[0]
	b.starty=listing[1] 
	b.list1=[b.startx,b.starty,b.startx+b.length,b.starty+b.breadth]
	def length():
		return b.length
	def breadth():
		return b.breadth
	def list1():
		return b.list1
	def xstart():
		return b.startx
	def ystart():
		return b.starty
	def move(newlist):
	 	b.startx=newlist[0]
		b.starty=newlist[1]
		b.list1=[b.startx,b.starty,b.startx+b.length,b.starty+b.breadth]
	a=box1() 
	a.length=length
	a.breadth=breadth
	a.list1=list1
	a.move=move
	a.xstart=xstart
	a.ystart=ystart
	return a
robot = robot1([10,15])
#+END_EXAMPLE
this the encapsulation that i have done on different fields
** Class work():
- this class i have added all my fuction so that i could make it an object orinted code....
- the object that i have made..i am initializing all things at the starting...and i am calling the object at the last.
* _Advantages_:
** Use of classes:
- Reduces the lenght of code
- Increases the efficiency
- A simple declaration runs the entire program..

Yes,my design is quite flexble that you can reuse the codefor a different GUI.
 
* _Miscellaneous_:
-firstly the robot is made by calling the class box1 and function robot1 encapsulating different fields into it..
And at last i am calling the main class which has all my function to work ...it consits 6 function start1,start2,start3,game1,game2,game3....
* _Extra Features_:
-i have varied the speed in each level...i have made 3 level
** 1st level:
it comprises ofthe robot and the normal defuse codes ..
** 2nd level:
it comprises of two window obtacles..if ot touches it the game will end...
** 3rd level:
it comprises of two window obstacles located in any place and 4 mimes...so if iy touches any of them ...the game will end directly...
